// okay heres where the real deal will start 
/*
=============Constants=================
 i think therer are going to be hella consts im going to make here 
 - const keyboard;
 - const timer 
 - const challengerWord
 - const retry 
 - const playerGuess
 - const wordArray = [
    { word: example 
     hint: something to help them out maybe?
    }
    ]
- const maxGuess = 10 or someething 
- const timeLimit = 1000 seconds or something 

 ============Lets======================
 - let activeWord 
 - let correctLetters
 - let incorrectCount 
 - let timerSeconds
=============functions ================
function resetGame() to clear the board 

function getRandomWord () to grab from the wordArray 

function createTimer() this will be pretty easy to implement just starting the timer we set in the const tab 

function endGame() this will be to check if the player has either has won or lost the game 

function startGame() {
this will contain pretty much all the other functions to start this}
