/* Okay this will be explaining what im going to do here my pseudocode */ 

/*first things first 

-- This will be where i set up my margins and font 

    - im thinking times new roman (something basic) 

    - margin and padding of 0 
    
    -bordered box to announce the name of the game 

--after that i'm setting up the body that will be inside of the html 

    - I'll use a flex box here justify content center so that it can be well centered

    i can create the height the system of set up and everything else that will go into detailing it 

-- here i want to have the container that will share multiple traits. i think i'll call it .container or something like that 

    --this one i will ahve to see to turly be able to mae but ill start with the pixels for the screen stuff like that 

-- I want to make a place to maybe put in your name here, so you could maybe set up a leaderboard. I'm not super sure how hard this one will be but we will see. 

    -- i want to attach this to an arra that the player can add to 

-- ill make a timer next gives the player a couple seconds to do the task that we set up for them, in this instance it'll be chosing a letter

-- ill make the box of letters right here 

    -- itll be an array that i can use a foreach loop to iterate between. I thin that this one will be a little hard to implement so ill have to examine how i can do this one properly

--finally i can make the actual hang man image right here. I think that i can use pictures of the hangman to make this and slowly reveal them with an on click function here
